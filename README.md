# react-webpack-starter
A no-frills get started now package for those interested in React, Reflux, ES6 & Webpack.

## What this is:
It's a demonstration of

1. Using webpack to compile ES6 JavaScript to ES5 JavaScript to work on run-of-the-mill browsers
2. Getting started with basic React components using ES6 syntax.
3. Getting started using Reflux Stores & Actions.

## What this is not:
A substitute for reading the docs.  Find them [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/), [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html), and [here](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs)

## Getting Started:
1. Make sure you've got nodejs installed.  You can easily find guides elsewhere to do this.
2. Clone this repo & `cd` into the root directory
3. Install necessary npm packages using `npm install`.  
4. `npm start` to start the webpack-dev-server.
5. Navigate to `localhost:8080`.
6. To build (eg. for production), run `npm run build`

## Suggestions on how to make this better?  
Fork and submit a PR as usual.
